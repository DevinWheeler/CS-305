This repository contains the Project 2 report, which I completed for Artemis Financial. Artemis Financial, a financial services company, needed secure communication protocols and code refactoring to comply with software security testing standards. In this project, I recommended the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm due to its reliability and global trust for securing sensitive data. The implementation included generating certificates, deploying the cipher, and ensuring secure HTTPS communication for the application.

Through thorough secondary and functional testing, I verified the refactored code executed without errors and helped the applicationâ€™s security. The project shows the importance of using industry-standard best practices, such as well-established cryptographic algorithms and secure communication protocols, to protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity. This report showcases my ability to identify security vulnerabilities, apply effective mitigation techniques, and ensure the software aligns with industry standards, showing my skills in secure coding and software security.
